Basic Flow:
    1. Game starts
    2. Board creates the blocks
    3. Board adjusts its position according to m and n
    4. Board tells Helper to check the blocks
    5. Helper loops over all blocks and tells them to calculate
    6. Blocks calculate the blocks they would explode if they were to be clicked on
    7. Blocks save this information and send it to Helper
    8. Helper checks if there's any block that can explode any blocks and passes the information to the board
    9. Board enables input
    10. Player clicks on a block
    11. Block checks if there's blocks it can destroy
    12. Block passes the to-be-destroyed blocks to the board
    13. Board disables input
    14. Board pushes each block to the pool
    15. Board pulls new blocks from the pool
    16. Board sends the information of all the blocks that need to fall down to the animator
    17. Animator adds the blocks to the list
    18. Animator checks if there are blocks in the list
    19. Animator iterates through all the blocks in the list on each update and moves them slightly towards their destinations
    20. Animator checks if the block reached its destination
    
Alternative Flow:
    8a. There are blocks that can be clicked on, continue from 9
    8b. There are no blocks that can be clicked on, Board shuffles the blocks, jump to 4
    11a. It has blocks it can destroy, continue from 12
    11b. It does not have blocks it can destroy, do nothing and wait for another click
    18a. There are blocks in the list, continue from 19
    18b. There are no blocks in the list, jump to 4
    20a. Block has reached the destination, remove it from the list and continue iteration
    20b. Block has not reached the destination, continue iteration
